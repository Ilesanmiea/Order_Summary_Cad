## Overview

### The challenge
This challenge requires me to ensure that users should be able to use hover states for interactive elements which I was able to complete using the Pseudo-Selectors `(:hover)`  precisely for the affected elements as shown in the designs.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
- I am happy to complete this project because it has helped me to upgrade my CSS learning. This is my first ever project using the CSS Custom Properties.  After Studying CSS variables, I took it on practically by using its application on this **Order Card Sumary Project** and it was to me intelligence catching fun.

-In addition to this, personally I learnt 12 ways to be able to center a div in CSS which was very fun to me using `parent div` and also `child div` on `HTML`.
**These are snippets of codes that I personally put on this.**

```css
:root {
  --body-background-color: rgb(224, 232, 255);
  --container-content-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);
  --inner-background-color: rgb(245, 247, 255);
  --button-background-color: hsl(245, 75%, 52%);
  --button-text-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);
  --cancel-text-color: rgb(31, 47, 86);
}
section {
  display: flex;
}
.container {
  margin: auto;
}
```

### Continued development

Though I am happy about this project and thank God for this but I have so much to do in future to improve the way of how I write my *clean code* especially I want my focus to be squarely on writing **Modern CSS** and doing great project with a few lines of codes.


### Useful resources

- **Modern CSS(Master the Key Concepts of CSS for Modern Web Development by Joe Attardi)** - This helped me for CSS Varaibles. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Codestackr](https://www.codestackr.com) - This has helped me to learn how to center a div in different 1 ways by experienced tutor
